The divergence functional $\Phi[\psi] = \int V(|\psi|^2) d\mu$ depends only on magnitudes $|\psi|^2$, hence is invariant under global $U(1)$ rotations $\psi \to e^{i\theta}\psi$. For anomaly cancellation with three generations in four dimensions (Theorem \ref{thm:standardModelGaugeGroupDerivation}), left-handed fermions must be grouped into $SU(2)_L$ doublets to cancel the $[SU(2)]^2[U(1)]$ and mixed $[SU(3)]^2[U(1)]$ anomalies.

The right-handed fermions remain singlets because:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Including them in doublets would overcount degrees of freedom.
\item The parity violation observed in weak interactions requires this asymmetry.
\item Anomaly cancellation uniquely selects this chirality structure.
\end{enumerate}

Local gauge invariance follows by promoting global $SU(2)$ to local: $U(x) \in SU(2)_L$. The connection must transform as:
\begin{equation}
W_\mu \to U W_\mu U^\dagger - \frac{i}{g_2}(\partial_\mu U) U^\dagger
\end{equation}
to maintain covariant derivative properties. The non-Abelian field strength and Yang-Mills action follow from standard gauge theory construction.
