\begin{theorem}[Floer Homology Rank Bounds for Configuration Space]
\label{thm:floerRankBoundsConfiguration}
Consider the configuration space $\mathcal{H}$ with the Riemannian metric induced by the Hessian of $\Phi$ (Theorem \ref{thm:hodgeStructureConfiguration}). Equip it with a Morse function (e.g., $\mathcal{F} = \|\Phi\|^2$) and consider Floer homology $\text{HF}_*(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{F})$.

Then the Floer homology groups satisfy:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The total Floer homology rank $\text{rank}(\text{HF}_*)$ is bounded above by the rank of the singular homology: $\text{rank}(\text{HF}_*) \leq \text{rank}(H_*(\mathcal{H}))$.
\item For the divergence-first configuration space with three-channel structure, this rank is exactly 3.
\item The three Floer homology generators correspond to the three information channels.
\end{enumerate}

This establishes that the three-channel structure is not merely mathematical convenience but has topological meaning: it is detected by Floer homology.
\end{theorem}
