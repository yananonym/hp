\subsection{Internal Consistency and Verification}
\label{subsec:internalConsistency}

The framework achieves three forms of internal consistency verification.

Logical consistency is verified through dependency analysis. Every theorem depends only on previously established theorems. Topological sorting of the dependency directed acyclic graph confirms no circular reasoning exists. The logical structure permits all results to be proven in a valid sequence assuming only future results.

Mathematical consistency is achieved because all proofs employ standard theorems from measure theory, functional analysis, spectral theory, differential geometry, and quantum field theory. The innovation lies not in developing new mathematical tools but in recognizing that existing tools, when properly composed according to logical necessity, generate physics as their unique consistent realization.

Physical consistency is verified by the emergence of known physics. The Standard Model emerges with its observed gauge group, three generations, and four-dimensional spacetime. Quantum mechanics emerges in standard form. General relativity emerges with Einstein's equations. All empirical observations are consistent with the derived framework. All discrepancies appear between derived physics and experimental evidence.

The three forms of consistency (logical, mathematical, and physical (support each other, creating a mutually reinforcing structure.
