By Corollary \ref{cor:volumeForm}, the Riemannian volume form relates to the measure:
\begin{equation}
\text{Vol}_g(B_r(p)) = \int_{B_r(p)} \sqrt{\det g(x)} \, d^Q x = \int_{B_r(p)} \rho(x) d\mu(x),
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the Radon-Nikodym derivative with $c_1 \leq \rho(x) \leq c_2$.

By Ahlfors regularity of $\mu$ from Axiom \ref{ax:polishSpace}(c):
\begin{equation}
c_1 \mu(B_r(p)) \leq \text{Vol}_g(B_r(p)) \leq c_2 \mu(B_r(p)).
\end{equation}

Since $\mu(B_r(p)) \sim r^Q$ by Axiom \ref{ax:polishSpace}(c), the conclude:
\begin{equation}
\text{Vol}_g(B_r(p)) \sim r^Q.
\end{equation}

This establishes the polynomial volume growth with geometric dimension equal to the regularity dimension $Q$.
