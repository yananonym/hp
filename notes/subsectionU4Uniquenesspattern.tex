\subsection{The Pattern of Uniqueness Throughout the Framework}
\label{subsec:uniquenessPattern}

A striking characteristic of the divergence-centric framework is the pervasive appearance of uniqueness theorems. Where historical theories involve numerous choices among alternatives, the divergence framework forces unique solutions.

Spacetime dimension cannot be chosen freely. Four independent consistency constraints converge to force dimension exactly four. value alone satisfies all four constraints simultaneously.

Spacetime signature cannot be chosen freely. Bregman divergence asymmetry enforces time reversal asymmetry, forcing Lorentzian rather than Euclidean signature.

The gauge group cannot be chosen freely. Anomaly cancellation equations have a unique solution for the fermion content and dimension derived earlier. All alternative gauge group satisfies all anomaly constraints.

The number of generations cannot be arbitrary. Topological consistency of the three-channel divergence structure enforces exactly three families. Fewer leaves anomalies uncanceled. More reintroduces them.

The renormalization group fixed point cannot be arbitrary. Transversality of six constraint surfaces in coupling space determines a unique fixed point. All other coupling values satisfy all six constraints simultaneously.

This pattern extends throughout the framework. Mathematical consistency eliminates freedom at each stage. The resulting theory is highly constrained, with remarkably few free parameters. The coupling constants of gauge interactions and the masses of fermions emerge from anomaly cancellation constraints. The parameters constitute freely adjustable but determined by internal consistency.

The universe described by the divergence-centric framework is not selected from a vast landscape of possibilities. It is the unique consistent realization of the axioms.
