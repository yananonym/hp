\subsection{Symplectic Structure from Divergence Asymmetry (Subsection A.6)}
\label{subsec:symplecticDivergence}

The asymmetry of the Bregman divergence, inherent in Axiom II's breaking of time-reversal symmetry, induces a symplectic structure on configuration space. This structure is essential for Floer homology and the topological count of three generations.

\begin{definition}[Symplectic Form from Divergence Asymmetry]
\label{def:symplecticFormDivergence}

For any base point $\psi_0 \in \mathcal{H}$, define the skew-symmetric 2-form:
\begin{equation}
\omega_{\psi_0}(h, k) := \mathrm{Im}\left(\int_X \overline{h}(x) \, (D^2\Phi[\psi_0])^{-1} k(x) \, d\mu(x)\right),
\end{equation}
where the inverse Hessian $(D^2\Phi[\psi_0])^{-1}$ exists by strict convexity. This is a closed 2-form (satisfying $d\omega = 0$ in the distributional sense).

\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Non-Degeneracy of Symplectic Structure]
\label{lem:symplecticNonDegenerate}

The form $\omega_\psi$ is non-degenerate: if $\omega_\psi(h, k) = 0$ for all $k \in \mathcal{H}$, then $h = 0$. This follows immediately from the invertibility of $D^2\Phi[\psi]$ guaranteed by Axiom II's coercivity condition.

\end{lemma}
