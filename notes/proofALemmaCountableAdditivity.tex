\textbf{Step 1: Cylinder Set Algebra.}
Define the cylinder $\sigma$-algebra on the path space $\mathcal{P} = C([0,\beta], \mathcal{H})$:
\[
\mathcal{C} := \sigma\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \pi_n^{-1}(\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n))\right)
\]
where $\pi_n: \mathcal{P} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ are coordinate projections onto $(c_1, \ldots, c_n)$ in the eigenfunction expansion of the path $\psi(\tau) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k(\tau) e_k$.

Elements of $\mathcal{C}$ are cylinder sets of the form:
\[
C_{I,B} := \{\psi \in \mathcal{P} : (c_{i_1}, \ldots, c_{i_m}) \in B\} \quad \text{for finite } I = \{i_1, \ldots, i_m\}
\]
and $B$ Borel in $\mathbb{R}^m$.

\textbf{Step 2: Characteristic Functional and Bochner-Minlos Theorem.}
The cylindrical measures $\mu_N$ have characteristic functionals:
\[
\hat{\mu}_N(\xi) := \int_{\mathcal{P}} e^{i\langle \xi, \psi \rangle} d\mu_N(\psi)
\]
defined for $\xi$ in the algebraic dual $\mathcal{P}'$.

For the limiting functional $\hat{\mu}(\xi) := \lim_{N \to \infty} \hat{\mu}_N(\xi)$ to correspond to a countably additive measure, it suffices (by Minlos 1959) to verify continuity in the Sazonov topology on $\mathcal{P}'$.

\textbf{Step 3: Sazonov Topology and Continuity.}
The Sazonov topology is generated by seminorms induced by Hilbert-Schmidt operators. By Lemma~\ref{lem:traceClassInverse}, the covariance operator $C = (-A)^{-1}$ satisfies: $(I - e^{tA})C$ is Hilbert-Schmidt for each $t > 0$.

This ensures that the characteristic functional extends continuously from cylinder sets to the Sazonov topology, satisfying the Bochner-Minlos hypotheses.

\textbf{Step 4: Uniform Tightness Implies Countable Additivity.}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:pathIntegralConstruction} Step 4, the family $\{\mu_N\}$ is uniformly tight: for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists compact $K_\epsilon \subset \mathcal{P}$ with $\mu_N(K_\epsilon) > 1 - \epsilon$ for all $N$.

By Billingsley (1999, Theorem 5.1), uniform tightness on a complete separable metric space (which $\mathcal{P}$ is) implies that any weak limit point is a Radon measure, hence countably additive on $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{P})$.

\textbf{Step 5: Uniqueness and Extension.}
The cylinder $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{C}$ is a $\pi$-system (closed under finite intersections) that generates the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{P})$. By the $\pi$-$\lambda$ (Dynkin) theorem, if two measures agree on $\mathcal{C}$, they agree on $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{P})$.

By consistency of finite-dimensional marginals (Kolmogorov's theorem) and weak convergence, the limit $\mu_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is uniquely determined and countably additive on $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{P})$. \qed
