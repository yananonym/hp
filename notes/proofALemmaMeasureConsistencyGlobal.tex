\noindent\textbf{Part (i): Invariance Under Divergence-Induced Flow}

The divergence-induced temporal evolution of the measure $\mu$ under the natural flow generated by the Bregman divergence gradient must preserve the total measure globally. Define the divergence flow as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\psi_t}{dt} = -\nabla D_\Phi(\psi_t \| \psi_0) = -[D\Phi(\psi_t) - D\Phi(\psi_0) - \text{const}].
\end{equation}

Under this flow, the measure $\mu$ satisfies the continuity equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\mu v_t) = 0,
\end{equation}
where $v_t = -\nabla D_\Phi(\psi_t \| \psi_0)$ is the velocity field. By the divergence theorem on the Polish space $(X, d, \mu)$ (which admits a finite diameter covering), integrating over any measurable set $E \subset X$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} \mu(E) = -\int_E \nabla \cdot (\mu v_t) d\mu = -\int_{\partial E} \mu v_t \cdot n \, d\sigma,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the boundary measure and $n$ is the outward normal.

For $E = X$ (the entire Polish space), the boundary term vanishes by compactness and regularity of $\mu$ (Axiom I ensures the measure is outer-regular). Therefore:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} \mu(X) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mu(X) = \text{constant} = 1 \text{ (probability measure)}.
\end{equation}

Thus the measure is invariant under the divergence flow globally.

\noindent\textbf{Part (ii): Equivalence of Measure-Zero Sets and Topological Negligibility}

A set $A \subset X$ is $\mu$-null (measure zero) if and only if it is topologically negligible with respect to the metric measure structure on $X$. By Axiom I (Ahlfors regularity), every Borel set $A$ satisfies:
\begin{equation}
\mu(A) = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \text{all limit points of } A \text{ are nowhere dense in } X.
\end{equation}

More precisely, for the Ahlfors $Q$-regular measure:
\begin{equation}
\mu(A) = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \dim_{\text{Hausdorff}}(A) < Q.
\end{equation}

This equivalence is well-established for Polish spaces with Ahlfors regular measures (\cite{ambrosio2005gradient}, Theorem 1.1). Consequently, the $\mu$-negligible $\sigma$-algebra coincides with the completion of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra, ensuring that the measure is regular:

\begin{equation}
\forall E \text{ measurable}, \forall \epsilon > 0: \exists U \text{ open}, F \text{ closed} : F \subseteq E \subseteq U, \, \mu(U \setminus F) < \epsilon.
\end{equation}

\noindent\textbf{Part (iii): Regularity and $\sigma$-Finiteness}

The Polish space $(X, d, \mu)$ admits a countable covering by compact sets $\{K_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ (since Polish spaces are separable and completely metrizable). By Axiom I, each compact subset has finite measure:
\begin{equation}
\mu(K_n) < \infty \quad \forall n.
\end{equation}

Therefore, the measure is $\sigma$-finite:
\begin{equation}
\mu(X) = \mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty K_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(K_n \setminus K_{n-1}) < \infty.
\end{equation}

Outer regularity (that $\mu(A) = \inf\{\mu(U) : A \subseteq U, U \text{ open}\}$) follows from Caratheodory's extension theorem applied to the Ahlfors regular measure (\cite{ambrosio2005gradient}, Definition 1.1).

\noindent\textbf{Conclusion:} The measure $\mu$ is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Globally invariant under the divergence-induced flow (Part i)
\item Outer-regular with measure-zero sets forming a regular ideal (Part ii)
\item $\sigma$-finite with countable support decomposition (Part iii)
\end{enumerate}

Thus the measure satisfies all global consistency requirements for the divergence-first foundation to be mathematically coherent. \qed
